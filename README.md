# Ground Plane Editor
This plugin is used for changing the opacity and color of the ground plane feature in Blockbench.
## Worth noting:
- There is currently no way to revert back to the default ground plane. However, adding this feature is planned. For now you'll have to uninstall the plugin and restart Blockbench to revert back to the default.
- Just like the default ground plane, changing it's properties in one tab will update in other tabs as well.
## How to use:
To use this plugin, simply go to <b>Tools > Ground Plane Editor</b>, fill out the appropriate categories, and hit <b>Done</b>. You can choose to edit either the color, the opacity, or both!
